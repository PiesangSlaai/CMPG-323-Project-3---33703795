I was given an ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application that needed to be enhanced and improved by adding repository patterns. The Project is hosted on azure and displays a simple website that has a home screen and a login or register feature. This application is connected to a database which contains information about a store, specifically its product list, customer list and its orders list. All information in the database can be manipulated using the UI.

user guide:
1. User is greeted with home screen and is presented with 2 options
2. User will either register a new account or login with existing account
3. For register, the user will enter their email and password and create a new account.
4. A email confirmation will then be sent to the user asking them to confirm their account
5. For login, the user will enter their email and password and login to their account
6. The user will then be able to select 3 options on the bar at the top of the screen namely Products, Customers and Orders
7. Each button will redirect the user to the appropriate page where information will be presented to them
8. For each option, the user has the ability to create a new entry, edit information, view details of an entry or delete an entry entirely
